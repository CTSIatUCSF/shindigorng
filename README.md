===========

Version of Shindig that connects to Profiles and VIVO.  Based on shindig-project-2.5.0 tag

You can find the shinidig depedencies at http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/shindig

The json-ld dependencies can be found at http://github.com/jsonld-java
The one change that is requried is to update the top jsonld-java pom.xml file to use jena.version 2.11.1 instead of 2.11.0
This is required for the TDB items.
